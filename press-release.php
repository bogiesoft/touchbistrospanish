		<h3>Touchbistro Wins 2015 International App Of The Year Award</h3>

		<span class="strapline">Best in Biz International Awards selects TouchBistro as the Gold Winner of the 2015 International App of the Year competition</span>

		<p><span class="strong">NEW YORK</span> and <span class="strong">TORONTO</span> – August 12, 2015 – TouchBistro has been named the 2015 International App of the Year by the Best in Biz Awards. The Best in Biz Awards is the only independent global business awards program judged by members of the press and industry analysts. TouchBistro was one of the 250+ public and private companies representing all sectors of the global economy spanning more than 30 countries that participated in this third annual International Award program.</p>

		<p>TouchBistro brings mobile innovation to the food and beverage industry with its iPad point-of-sale solution, which is easy to use, packed with smart features, and integrated with multiple traditional and mobile payment processing options. The TouchBistro app is consistently ranked as the number one top-grossing food and beverage app in 34 countries on the Apple® App Store℠.</p>

		<p>TouchBistro continually invests in new technology, striving to make its app the most advanced, easy-to-use mPOS solution for restaurants and bars. Waiters and waitresses can use the TouchBistro iPad app to take customer orders tableside, or while patrons are in line or at the bar, and instantly submit them to the kitchen and bartender/barista. Bills are automatically calculated and split according to the patrons’ requests, and bill totals are transferred electronically into integrated card keypads or mobile wallets for payment, thereby minimizing order errors and increasing operations efficiency. A full suite of cloud reporting tools is provided with the system, addressing everything from seating, inventory, and sales analysis to scheduling and payroll. With the TouchBistro POS app, restaurateurs are better equipped to improve the bottom line and deliver a superior experience to their customers.</p>

		<p>"We are honored that TouchBistro is the International App of the Year Gold Winner in the 2015 Best in Biz International Awards. This award is a tremendous recognition of the hard work and accomplishments we set out to achieve this year,” said Alex Barrotti, TouchBistro Founder and CEO.</p>

		<p>"TouchBistro is a truly innovative mobile POS solution tailored specifically for food service operations. It is designed to work as the heart and operating system of a restaurant or bar, significantly increasing efficiencies and the overall customer experience,” Barrotti continued. “We partnered with restaurateurs and bar owners to determine exactly how a POS system should work to support a high speed food and drink service environment. Then we developed the technology to deliver the features that matched those market insights, enabled by an intuitive interface that is simple and fast to learn. Our growing customer base is a testament to our deep understanding of how to help restaurants and bars improve their operations and our commitment to their success."</p>

		<p>TouchBistro also provides seamless integration with popular apps that offer restaurant and bar patrons greater convenience using their mobile devices – all the way from booking a restaurant reservation to scheduling taxi transportation, ordering meals and instantly seeing the bill, securely paying, and processing loyalty rewards.</p>

		<p>TouchBistro is one of the few companies in this competition to win multiple Best in Biz 2015 International awards. In addition to being the Gold Winner of the International App of the Year, TouchBistro CEO Alex Barrotti received the silver award for 2015 International Founder/Entrepreneur of the Year. The TouchBistro customer service team placed as the Bronze winner for the 2015 International Support Department/Team of the Year.</p>

		<p>“Successes in business don’t just happen. You create them by having great people with ideas and a plan, who take risks because they have to for the good of their respective industry, and for their stakeholders, whether the shareholders or customers. I’m sure each of these companies have stories about their failures – every company does – but the ability to reach the heights each of them have attained should be applauded, and I can think of no better way than with this Best in Biz Awards recognition,” said Eric Alper, CTV (Canada), returning to judge his third Best in Biz Awards competition.</p>
